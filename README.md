# Consolero Pro

## Why is it called "Pro"?

Initially "Consolero" was an ingame console for a game I developed. It was just that. A console to
enter ingame commands to trigger certain things. But then I decided to add all output logs to the
console aswell. This is when I decided to call it "Pro".

## What is it?

It's a configurable console with commands which shows all unity output (Can be turned off) aswell as custom logged
message.
